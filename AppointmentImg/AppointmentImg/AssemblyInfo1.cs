// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following
// set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information
// associated with an assembly.


// In SDK-style projects such as this one, several assembly attributes that were historically
// defined in this file are now automatically added during build and populated with
// values defined in project properties. For details of which attributes are included
// and how to customise this process see: https://aka.ms/assembly-info-properties


// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible to COM
// components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from COM, set the ComVisible
// attribute to true on that type.

[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

// The following GUID is for the ID of the typelib if this project is exposed to COM.

[assembly: Guid("91bf9020-e81c-4d40-8be0-1dd4f725b7ab")]
